Tool Share
Tool Share is a web-application that allows users to rent/lease household tools, that may be expensive and not have a very frequent need for the lender. It could be affordably leased for a limited time thereby avoiding the need to purchase the tool. 

The users can post a tool, reserve/rent a particular tool and can also share their stories/experiences on using a particular tool.
